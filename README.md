# D3-Challenge

For this homework assignment, I investigate the correlation between income and obesity rate. The chart shows there is a downward trend of a lower obesity rate when income is higher within the state.  

This data is from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). 

The work was done using the D3 Javascript Library
